# unscramble

## Dataset
Named oops_12. This file is a scrambled version of a piece of literature. The objective is to de-code the gibberish and return the text file back into English.

## translate_doc
This Python file does exactly that- it returns a file that makes sense in English, creates a frequency table for the occurrence of each letter in the file (treating upper/lower case as identical).

## histogram_oopsdata
Visualizes the oops_12.txt data. Obtains a graphical representation through a histogram of the frequency table.
